An App that focuses on Users, and user routes.

RUN:  server.js

Runs via RESTful API calls to the server.
There is a route to register a user, log in, GET Users, PATCH, and DELETE.

Plus there is middleware to provide Authorization and Credential validation VIA Bcrypt, and JWT Tokens.

Extensive Testing is via JEST.

There are 2 SQL servers each with a users table, one for deployment, and one for testing.

Technologies used:
    Node
    Express
    SQL
    pg
    JSON Web Tokens
    Bcrypt
    JavaScript
    RESTful API's
    Models
    Routes
