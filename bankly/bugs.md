First bug for me was getting jest to run.
The Jest in the dependancies is not compatible, and was causing errors such as:
"ReferenceError: TextEncoder is not defined"
So I had to download and install the latest versions of all dependancies.
After that jest executed, and all tests passed.
Sounds easy, but to a coding rookie like me, that took a couple of hours to debug!

I'm also having trouble with the seed command, which is generating errors. Having to execute the seed commands manually to effect.
